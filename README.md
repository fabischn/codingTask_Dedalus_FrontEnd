## Frontend part:
Implement a web application that supports following requirements:
* a user can enter a text and start the analysis with the press of a button
* The application uses the REST API of the server to analyze the user input (see backend part)
* the content of the analysis is displayed as a human readable output in the UI
* you are free to choose the technology/framework for the frontend (Angular preferred)
 
## Backend part:
A backend part should be a Java server app with a RESTful API interface (Spring Boot is allowed)  that would provide functionality of the Text Analyzer.
The Text Analyzer should also be refactored to be in a "good enough" state.
This basically means two things:
* A developer should not be ashamed to give his code to a colleague for a code review
* A company should not be afraid to sell this piece of software to another company
  
There is no right or wrong approach here.
The goal is to see how you handle things like testing, software design, integration of different technologies, vague requirements (like unspecified UI requirements or "good enough" concept), explanatory skills,â€¦
